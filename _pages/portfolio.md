## ðŸ¤– Computer Vision
### Vehicle Detection with CNN

A series of notebooks to dive deep into popular datasets for object detection and learn how to train Detectron2 on custom datasets.

After i  preprocessed a dataset of Customer Analysis and built machine learning models to predict cluster which the customer belongs to. I built an interactive user interface with flask and html.

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://github.com/marcello2k18/Medical-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Untitled.ipynb)

I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify important variables, handled missing values and outliers, and applied feature engineering. I then used machine learning models to predict insurance costs based on factors such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, and region.

### Bank Churn Prediction with SVM and Random Forest

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/marcello2k18/predicting-bank-churn/blob/main/UAS%20Individu%20Code.ipynb)
[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://github.com/marcello2k18/predicting-bank-churn)

In this project, I will perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the bank churn dataset, followed by data transformation using feature selection techniques. I will then build and train a machine learning model, specifically a Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features.
