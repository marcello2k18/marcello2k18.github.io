## Hobbies
### Epic Reading
Epic tales help me reflect on values, identity, and the timeless struggle between light and shadow. Growing up with Hindu influences in Indonesia, I was drawn to the *Mahabharata* and *Ramayana*. Later, I explored stories of Baldwin, Salahudin, and the Ottoman Empire—each filled with courage, honor, and the weight of destiny.

> "Sometimes, in the silence of a late night, I turn a page and suddenly feel like I’m walking beside Arjuna on the battlefield, or listening to Saladin’s quiet wisdom before a storm. In those moments, I’m not just reading—I’m living a thousand lives across time, carried by words that feel like destiny."
